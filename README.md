# Introduction
Dui-Chaka Cycling Club is based in the North East of Dhaka and it is a cycling club that was
founded in 2010. It was formed to allow older riders to get together and take part in regular 
gentle exercise. Although all kinds of cyclists are catered for, generally it is the older 
generation who attend most of the events and rides. The number of members has increased
due to an ageing population.

# Scenario
Dui-Chaka Cycling Club are open two evening per week and both Friday and
Saturday at weekends, and they organise events and rides for a range of abilities, covering 
different routes and difficulty of rides. The club has a calendar of events and there are 3 
different groups to choose from. The fast group start at 9am promptly on a Friday morning
and cover on average 50 km, the medium paced group start at 9am and cover on average 30
km. The slower pace group leave at 10.00am and cover on average 20 km. All groups meet
up for lunch at a local pub or eating place. New riders are always welcome.
The Cycling Club has approached you to develop a website that will promote the club to gain
new members. They have provided the following basic requirements for the contents of the
# website:
 An about us page: This will describe the club, its location and brief history.
 The groups page: This will describe the three different groups that riders can join.
 An events page: This will describe upcoming events and longer rides. This will include
overnight stays and events such as a coast to coast cycle that riders can take part in. There is 
also an annual dinner to celebrate the success of the club during the year.
 A club records page: This page will record the time-trial records for each year based on
different events e.g. 10 km, 25 km, 30 km, 50 km and 100 km.
 A How to Join page: This page will provide details on how to join the club and will include
membership prices and a registration form.
 Dui-Chaka On Tour: This page will display the photos and notes linked to longer rides e.g. 
where the members go abroad for a few days to cycle.
 A contact us page: This page will display the contact details of the cycling club.
This page will need to include a HTML form that interested cyclists can use to make enquiries 
to join the club. Users will need to enter their details such as name, email address, age and
level of cycling experience.
At the initial stage of the development process, you are required to make an HTML/CSS 
prototype of the website that will clearly show Dui-Chaka Cycling Club how the final 
website could work.
